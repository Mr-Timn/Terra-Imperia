Terra Imperia is a 2d fighting game made completely in Javascript by yours truly!

To play it all you have to do is open index.html
	* Known bug where one script will load out of sequence. Reload page to fix.


The entire project is far from being finished but I will continue working every so 
often. The original purpose of creating this was so I could work on my Javascript
skills and has become what it is today for that reason. Anyone is welcome to use it
as your own but credit is always very much appreciated. 


Progress:	
	* Currently I only have 3 characters added, Luffy, Mihawk, and Kizaru. All of 
	  which are from One Piece.
	* AI was created once for an older make of it but hasn't since been updated since
	  I rescripted most of the files.
